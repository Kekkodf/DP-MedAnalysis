# Repository for the Project developed during the PhD Course on "Statistics for Engineers"

## Contributors
This repository contains the code to develop the project for the course "Statistics for Engineers" of the PhD in Information Engineering at the University of Padova. The project is developed by Francesco L. De Faveri and Laura Menotti. Both authors contributed equally to the project.

## Conda environment
The conda environment named `24_DP_MedAnalysis` is defined in the file `environment.yml` in the `config` folder. To create the environment, run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f config/environment.yml
```
Once the environment has been resolved, to activate it run the following command:
```bash
conda 24_DP_MedAnalysis
```
