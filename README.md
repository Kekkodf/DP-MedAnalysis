# Repository for the Project developed during the PhD Course on "Statistics for Engineers"

## Contributors
This repository contains the code to develop the project for the course "Statistics for Engineers" of the PhD in Information Engineering at the University of Padova. The project is developed by Francesco L. De Faveri and Laura Menotti.

## Conda environment
The conda environment named `24_DP_MedAnalysis` is defined in the file `environment.yml` in the `config` folder. To create the environment, run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f config/environment.yml
```
Once the environment has been resolved, to activate it run the following command:
```bash
conda 24_DP_MedAnalysis
```

## Project structure
### H1 - Pre Summer School Project

`Folder: first presentation`

- Motivate the usefulness of the research presenting the case study;
- Describe the dataset, including its source, employing suitable plots and tables; 
- Perform a suitable one-sample tests
- Perform a suitable two-samples tests
- Perform an ANOVA or a Chi-square test

### H2 - Post Summer School Project

`Folder: second presentation`

- Linear, non-linear regression model or supervised Machine Learning algorithm
- Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm
- DOE analysis

## Project description - Differential Privacy and Medical Analysis

`Folder: project`

In the project, we aim to analyze the impact of the application of Differential Privacy (DP) on a medical dataset and perform classifications, clustering and other statistical analysis on the data. In the `project` folder, the slides of the presentations are reported.
